Hello all!, I am Saketh, a 2nd-year Masters student in ECE department at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), specializing in Robotics and AI. I graduated from [IIT Tirupati](https://www.iittp.ac.in/), where I majored in Electrical Engineering with honors.

Currently, I am a researcher at [Existential Robotics Laboratory](http://erl.ucsd.edu/), working on advancements in multi object tracking, advised by Prof. Nikolay Atanasov. 

Previously, at IIT Tirupati, I collaborated with Prof. P.S. Sai Krishna on a computing framework for autonomous vehicles. Our work was submitted to IEEE ROBIO and presented at the conference in December 2023 in Thailand.
