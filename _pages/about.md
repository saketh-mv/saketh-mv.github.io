Hello all!, I am Saketh, a 2nd-year Masters student in ECE department at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu), specializing in Robotics and AI. I graduated from [IIT Tirupati](https://www.iittp.ac.in/), where I earned my honors in Electrical Engineering.

Currently, I am a researcher at Center for Machine Intelligence, Computing and Security, leveraging the framework of 3D-Gaussain Splatting, under Prof. Tara Javidi 

Previously, at IIT Tirupati, I collaborated with Prof. P.S. Sai Krishna on a computing framework for autonomous vehicles. Our work was submitted to IEEE ROBIO and presented at the conference in December 2023 in Thailand.
