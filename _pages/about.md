<!-- I am a 2nd Year M.S. in ECE student at UC San Diego, specializing in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Control (ISRC). I completed my undergraduate from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, receiving an Honours degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Minor degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

Currently, I am a researcher at the Contextual Robotics Institue, working on Language-guided open-world mobile manipulation with a legged robot, advised by Prof. Xiaolong Wang . During my undergrad, I worked on my Bachelor's Thesis on Deep Reinforcement Learning for the Control of Soft Continuum robots advised by Prof. Abhishek Gupta and Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan. I also had the opportunity to intern at the University of Toronto, working with Prof. Lueder Kahrs at the Medical Computer Vision and Robotics (MEDCVR) lab for the summer of 2022. -->

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
