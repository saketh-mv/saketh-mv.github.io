Developed an end-to-end pipeline for estimating the 6D pose of objects from RGBD input using PointNet architecture, and using Roboflow for data annotation.

Applied advanced point cloud processing techniques such as Farthest Point Sampling to refine object pose accuracy, achieving 80% accuracy within 5Â° error.
