Developed a Text-to-3D pipeline integrating Gaussian Splatting and Variational Score Distillation, converting textual descriptions into detailed 3D meshes with enhanced fidelity and efficiency.

Integrated MV-Dream for improved 2D-to-3D coherence and SuGaR for efficient mesh extraction, achieving faster generation times and superior model quality across views.
