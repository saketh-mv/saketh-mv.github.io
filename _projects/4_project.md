Simulated a robot arm in PyBullet with an end-effector-mounted camera, enabling real-time object tracking, motion estimation, and efficient reaching behaviors through control strategies using visual feedback.

Designed an imitation learning framework leveraging behavioral cloning, enabling the arm to learn efficient reaching behaviors from human demonstrations.
