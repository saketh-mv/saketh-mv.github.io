Developed a semantic odometry pipeline using RGBD images and combining FPFH features with semantic cues to enhance the precision of robot pose estimation and enable real-time activity recognition in dynamic environments.

Integrated SE(3) transformations for continuous global registration and robot localization, while recognizing and categorizing robot activities (e.g., movement, interaction with objects) based on spatial-temporal cues.
