Developed an integrated real-time motion planning and navigation system for an autonomous robot (Roomba) in ROS2 using the Qualcomm RB5 platform, incorporating a LiDAR and camera for environmental sensing.

Designed and implemented path planning algorithms (A*, RRT) and integrated SLAM techniques (EKF, ICP) for precise localization and mapping, with real-time Pose graph optimization and Loop closure constraints
