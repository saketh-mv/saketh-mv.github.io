Overview:

Engineered an advanced KF-based multi-object tracking (MOT) system, leveraging probabilistic data association for superior tracking accuracy, increasing HOTA and MOTA metrics by almost 10%.

Integrating ReID features into the tracking pipeline, inspired by StrongSORT, to improve robustness in real-time tracking under occlusions and cluttered scenes.
